### With this project I'm answering the following 15 questions about 3 coffee shops in the New York.

**General Sales & Transactions:**
- How does the average transaction quantity vary across different store locations, and which location exhibits the highest variance in sales volume?
- What is the median unit price for each product category, and how do the interquartile ranges compare across categories?
- Are there any outliers in the transaction quantities based on the IQR (Interquartile Range) method?

**Time-Based Analysis:**
- What is the distribution of total sales per hour of the day, and at what time do stores experience the highest and lowest median sales?
- How do sales fluctuate by day of the week, and which weekday has the highest standard deviation in transaction quantities?
- What is the trend in total revenue over timeâ€”does it exhibit any seasonal patterns or anomalies?

**Store Performance:**
- What is the coefficient of variation (CV) in transaction quantities across different store locations, and which store shows the most consistent sales performance?
- How does the total revenue per store compare, and which store is the top performer in terms of both mean and median revenue?
- Which store has the highest average transaction value, and is there a significant difference between the top and bottom performers?

**Product Analysis:**
- What is the most frequently purchased product type, and how does its sales distribution compare to the least frequently purchased one?
- Which product category has the highest price variability, and what does the standard deviation suggest about price dispersion?
- Is there a significant difference in average unit price between different product types within the same product category?

**Customer Spending Behavior:**
- What percentage of transactions fall into the top 10% of transaction values, and how does this compare across store locations?
- What is the distribution of total revenue per transaction, and does it follow a normal distribution?
- How does the skewness and kurtosis of transaction values compare across different store locations?


Have Fun!
